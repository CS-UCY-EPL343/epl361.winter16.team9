External Stakeholders:

1.Government

	Ministry of Communications

		This department may play
		a particularly valuable role in promoting the hotline to the
		public as part of its wider safer internet activities; it will
		probably also be the department that will be in a position to
		decide whether a self-regulatory (as opposed to a formally
		regulated / legislated) hotline initiative is deemed adequate
		within the national context.


	Ministry of Justice
		The department with a remit for law enforcement (e.g.
		Ministry of Justice) – this department will be able to assist
		with legislative issues (assessment of what is illegal, etc)
		and so on, as well as endorsing involvement and resource
		from law enforcement. The hotline will also need a written
		agreement with this department (unless the agreement can
		be made directly with law enforcement) that the hotline
		employees have the right to receive reports and look at the
		content, etc – potentially by having the hotline’s operational
		procedures formally approved by them.

2.Law enforcement
	Try  to find the appropriate unit – there is a unit for child
	crime in most countries (which might also cover issues
	relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, family, and so
	on), and there may be also be a cybercrime unit that would
	be expected to lead on this. It may be difficult to find an
	obvious entry point as child exploitation online does not
	yet have a typical organisational home – is it a ‘cybercrime’
	which should be handled by the cybercrime unit or a real
	crime with ‘cyber evidence’ that should be handled by the
	child unit? If it is unclear from an external perspective, the
	relevant government department should be able to direct
	you. However, be prepared for the eventuality that it is not
	clearly defined and that cases are shared somewhat
	haphazardly across departments.
 	
	Secure offices, with no access for anyone not involved in
	the hotline – although you may wish to hold the initial
	meeting at the LEA’s offices, invite them to visit the hotline
	premises at a subsequent meeting so that they can see your
	operations for themselves.
